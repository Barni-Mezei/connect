# What is connect?
Connect is remote ssh tool, for your browser. You can open a terminal from any browser, and SSH to any public SSHs with it.

# The UI
When openening, the main page shows you a terminal. Here you can read about the program. This is the interface, that the SSh terminal will be opened inside.

### Settings

In the top right corner, there is a button, that opens the settings menu. Here you can reload the page (if you were to stuck in the terminal somehow), clear the terminal (this executes a 'clear' command, and clears the page in the browser), or set a preferred terminal theme. Also, this is where you can disable key capturing. You would want to do this, when you want access to the built-in browser shortcuts that require pressing special keys / key combinations, such as F3 or Ctrl + F

### Connect menu

The connect menu can be opened  by pressing the button in the top right corner of the screen. This is where you can ener your SSH credentials.You have to specify the SSH host (*where to connect*) the SSh port (*on which port is the SSH listening on* Default is 22) the SSH username (*which user would like to connect*) and the SSH password to that user. ***WARNING: The password is NOT encrypted, while travelling trough the network!***
